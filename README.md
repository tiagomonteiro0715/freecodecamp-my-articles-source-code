# FreeCodeCamp - My articles source code

[My FreeCodeCamp page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/tiagomonteiro)

Here you can find the code I use in my freecodecamp news articles. 

Here is one I have in another repository: [Signal Processing and Systems in Programming – Guide for Beginners](https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/Signal-Processing-and-Systems-in-Programming-Guide-for-Beginners)

And here is the github repository to the python and latex code of my book: [The Math Behind Artificial Intelligence A Guide to AI Foundations](https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/The-Math-Behind-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Guide-to-AI-Foundations/tree/main)

Additionally, the code images I create for my articles can also be found there. 

Feel free to use them

[Here](https://ray.so/) is the site I use to create the code images.
